length :: [a] -> Int
length = sum . map (const 1)

iter :: Int -> (a -> a) -> a -> a
iter 0 f = id
iter n f = f . iter (n-1) f

-- What is the type of the foloowing function?
-- \n -> iter n succ
-- Answer: Enum a => Int -> a -> a

sumSq :: Int -> Int
sumSq n = foldr (+) 0 (map (^2) [1..n])

mystery xs = foldr (++) [] (map sing xs)
    where sing x = [x]

-- (id . f) is the same as f because the result of f is fed to id which outputs
-- the sam result.

two xs ys = [ x+y | x <- xs, y <-ys ]
two'' xs ys =  concat (map (\x -> map (\y -> x+y) ys) xs) -- Tagen fr√•n facit
